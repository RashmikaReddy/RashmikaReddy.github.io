## Natural Language Processing



**Named Entity Recognition of ebay Listings:** Implemented Named Entity Recognition of eBayâ€™s listings as part of its Machine Learning competition. Computed and contrasted models built using Bi-directional LSTM, BERT to tag Brand, product type, model etc. Evaluated performance of both the models and BERT achieved an F1 score of 86%.
([GitHub](https://github.com/RashmikaReddy/Named-Entity-Recognition)).

**Quora Question similarity:** Converted the quora questions into a vector using TF-IDF, word2vec, on which classification algorithms, Logistic Regression, and Support vector machine are applied, achieving 50% less log-loss over baseline model Random Forest.
 ([GitHub](https://github.com/RashmikaReddy/Quora-Question-Similarity)).

 **Network Pruning and Quantization for LLMs:** : By conducting a comparative analysis of network pruning and LLM-int8 quantization techniques on a pre-trained RoBERTa Language Model for sentiment analysis, we achieved a significant reduction in inference time of at least 4x for both techniques. These findings demonstrate the potential of network pruning and quantization techniques for optimizing the deployment of Language Models in resource-constrained environments, without compromising the model's accuracy in sentiment analysis.
